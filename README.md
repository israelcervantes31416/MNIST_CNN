# MNIST_CNN

**Abstract:** This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for visual classification tasks using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The approach involves building a deep learning model capable of identifying patterns in grayscale images of clothing items across ten categories. Through careful data preparation and the integration of convolutional, pooling, and dropout layers, the model is trained to extract meaningful visual features and generalize effectively. The work emphasizes the role of CNNs in automated image recognition and demonstrates their potential in real-world computer vision applications.
